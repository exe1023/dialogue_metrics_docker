To abreast you further, the fund is\n    presently deposited with a private Bank in Madrid-Spain valued\n    \\u20ac10,000,000.00 Euros. I had opened a direct communication with our family\n    lawyer who resides in Spain that due to the present situation we faced down\n    here, i am mandating that the valued fund shall be remitted to you as our\n    foreign representative which he had assented.\n    \n    I lost my loving husband to hands of death during the early stage of the\n    fight presently ravaging my home country as i cannot leave here until you\n    receive the fund and send us an official Letter of Invitation to enable me\n    and my two daughters depart to your country. They faced daily threats as my\n    late husbands hospital were burnt down as well.\n    \n    Our family attorney is Barrister Aliberas Morros MT. He shall prepare all\n    legal documentations on your names as the new Benefactor so we shall not\n    violate legal ethics making you as our foreign partner to receive our fund\n    in your Bank Account since documents are presently in my husbands name\n    while i am his next of kin. I have the legal POWERS to change the documents\n    to your name since our lawyer had assented which means, he\n    shall ensure all documents are change to your names for the approval to be\n    granted by the Bank on your behalf for the release of the fund to you.\n    \n    Also note that you are entitled with 30% of the total fund when received by\n    you as you shall also assist us to purchase a house alongside help to put\n    my daughters in school. Investment shall be appreciated with your sincere\n    word/advice. This is our future therefore i am entrusting you with the\n    future of my daughters in your hands so be aware of the immense trust we\n    are reposing in you as my partner and confidant.\n    \n    As the attorney had already advised, you are to send below details which i\n    shall forward to him to ensure all documents are been changed to your names\n    as new Benefactor.\n    \n    (a)Your full Names:\n    (b) Your physical mailing address:\n    (c) Your direct telephone numbers:\n    (d) Your occupation:\n    \n    Best Regards,\n    Dr.Sarah Moses.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    On 9/10/20, Kimberly.Sanderscsl.sri.com kimberly.sanderscsl.sri.com wrote:\n     Hey,\n    \n     This is going to sound strange, but that's never stopped me before.\n    \n     Would it be possible for you to send over a Word document containing the\n     contents of the message to which I'm replying?

Last w=\n    eek Tuesday, as i was\n    \n    making my usual routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an=\n    abandoned shipment from London and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed=\n    huge sum of\n    \n    money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg With Registration R=\n    BT-45C. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignme=\n    nt was not\n    \n    properly declared by the consignee as \"MONEY\" rather it was declared as per=\n    sonal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat =\n    to pay for the\n    \n    United States Non Inspection Charges which is 3,700USD. On my assumption t=\n    he consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Miami Interna=\n    tional Airport Fl, USA till date.\n    \n    The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and=\n    the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are\n    \n    tagged on the Trunk box.\n    \n    However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consi=\n    gnment as the assistant director of Inspection Unit, I will advise you prov=\n    ide your current\n    \n    Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds w=\n    ith the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Air=\n    port around your\n    \n    city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned t=\n    o the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the de=\n    lays in\n    \n    concluding the clearance process so as a result of this, I will be waiting =\n    to receive your details on my official email address agentronaldmacleodyah=\n    http://oo.com__;Nv3xtKNH_4uope03_zb2N8Xt09hOBwXNdwA8VzZkZJ3CMOsusrq5kGkdN9v4jdJhctmbQKABoO-Jg   So in\n    \n    order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send t=\n    he required details to my private email address for quick processing and re=\n    sponse. Once I\n    \n    confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything =\n    concluded within 48 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address =\n    for delivery.\n    \n    Please Reconfirm The Following Information For Your Delivery.\n    \n    (1) Your name...........

During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in New York, and when scanned\n it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about 8M or more.\n    \n    The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either av\noid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c\nonsignment is delayed and abandoned.\n    \n    As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali\nd non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi\ncation).

I am interested. \n    \n      \n    Do you have a mobile number I can call? Or a ZOOM meeting room that we can chat with? \n     Or is there a better way to talk?  \n    \n    I still don't recall this package. Could it be for someone else? Or maybe different street? Who sent it or at least what city is it from? \n    \n    Could you take a picture of the package (which I think your company does) and email it to me? This is quite confusing to me.\n    \n    Did you want the postal address or residential? I also have a vacation home. Do you need that one? I don't see why you would, but you tell me.\n    \n     I'm happy to provide you with the details you requested but I'm a wee bit nervous that I might accidently send them to someone I can't trust. Can you please confirm with me yo\nur email address and another so I can be sure? Or send me a picture of you so I know who I am dealing with.\n    I don't have a bank account. I have a credit union account. Would that be sufficient? \n    \n    I'm not sure how to transfer the funds. Will it be difficult? Do I need to get a lawyer? \n    Is there another website I could look at? Or perhaps you have a better ida of what my problems could be. \n    Is there some special form I have to fill out to tell you that I'm the beneficiary? What is your definition of beneficiary? \n    I would be happy to fill it out if you send it to me. Do we need a lawyer?\n    \n    OK. When I have more questions, is there a phone number or other contact points where I can sms or contact you?\n    \n    \n    Jill\n    jill.knightcsl.sri.com\n    \n    Link:\n    -------------\n     [1] \n    https://public-exchange.csl.sri.com/staff/Jill.Knight/private-I0Dat0DatBIo/elf_l1_c21lZGlh\n"], "agent_name": "jill.knight@csl.sri.com", "response_scores": [{"USR-DRc": 0.9977926015853882, "USR-DRf": 0.9972085356712341, "USR-MLM": -2.4206342697143555, "USR": 0.6216115521689782}]}, {"dialogid": "jill.knight@csl.sri.com_07-28_13:35_to_07-29_11:57_5_TP108", "dialogue_context": [{"agent": "moneygramoffice60408354@gmail.com", "text": " IM111 email to UID1/jill.knightcsl.sri.com from UID52/moneygramoffice60408354gmail.com at 20200728_133537\n    subject:  [EXTERNAL] USD 6000 PAYMENT WE SENT TODAY TO PICK UP..0\n\n     Estimate Customer.\n    \n    You have been awarded 3.700, 000.00 through money gram Money Transfer for compensation to retain the good image of this country.\n    \n    Send your receiving information at ((( moneygramoffice60408354gmail.com ))) you have to be receiving a maximum of 6000 USD each day until the whole of 3.7M USD transfer comp\nlete.

Can you please confirm with me yo\nur email address and another so I can be sure? Or send me a picture of you so I know who I am dealing with.\n    I don't have a bank account. I have a credit union account. Would that be sufficient? \n    \n    I'm not sure how to transfer the funds. Will it be difficult? Do I need to get a lawyer? \n    Is there another website I could look at? Or perhaps you have a better ida of what my problems could be. \n    Is there some special form I have to fill out to tell you that I'm the beneficiary?

During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in New York, and when scanned\n it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about 8M or more.\n    \n    The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either av\noid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c\nonsignment is delayed and abandoned.\n    \n    As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali\nd non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi\ncation).
