I have the legal POWERS to change the documents\n    to your name since our lawyer had assented which means, he\n    shall ensure all documents are change to your names for the approval to be\n    granted by the Bank on your behalf for the release of the fund to you.\n    \n    Also note that you are entitled with 30% of the total fund when received by\n    you as you shall also assist us to purchase a house alongside help to put\n    my daughters in school.

For the delivery process, I do not know exactly what the delivery/clearance cost would be except I find out because am not direc\ntly in the position to give you the cost.\n    My plans are simple and that is to send the package to you via a shipping agency to the destination of your choice. We have 2 options:\n    \n    1) Ship the consignment (fund) directly to you to your doorstep and you pick it from the delivery agency.\n    \n    2)Ship the boxes to you alongside a delivery agent who will accompany the consignment and have it delivered to you by hand. He will follow the consignment to your destination a\nnd hand them over to you directly. Note that you will be the one to pay for the shipment cost. The option 2) \n    is better and costlier than option 1).\n    \n    You have chosen and let me know which one you prefer among the (2) two of them.

The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c\nonsignment is delayed and abandoned.\n    \n    As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali\nd non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi\ncation).

During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in New York, and when scanned\n it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about 8M or more.\n    \n    The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either av\noid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c\nonsignment is delayed and abandoned.\n    \n    As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali\nd non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi\ncation).

I am interested. \n    \n      \n    Do you have a mobile number I can call? Or a ZOOM meeting room that we can chat with? \n     Or is there a better way to talk?  \n    \n    I still don't recall this package. Could it be for someone else? Or maybe different street? Who sent it or at least what city is it from? \n    \n    Could you take a picture of the package (which I think your company does) and email it to me? This is quite confusing to me.\n    \n    Did you want the postal address or residential? I also have a vacation home. Do you need that one? I don't see why you would, but you tell me.\n    \n     I'm happy to provide you with the details you requested but I'm a wee bit nervous that I might accidently send them to someone I can't trust. Can you please confirm with me yo\nur email address and another so I can be sure? Or send me a picture of you so I know who I am dealing with.\n    I don't have a bank account. I have a credit union account. Would that be sufficient? \n    \n    I'm not sure how to transfer the funds. Will it be difficult? Do I need to get a lawyer? \n    Is there another website I could look at? Or perhaps you have a better ida of what my problems could be. \n    Is there some special form I have to fill out to tell you that I'm the beneficiary? What is your definition of beneficiary? \n    I would be happy to fill it out if you send it to me. Do we need a lawyer?\n    \n    OK. When I have more questions, is there a phone number or other contact points where I can sms or contact you?\n    \n    \n    Jill\n    jill.knightcsl.sri.com\n    \n    Link:\n    -------------\n     [1] \n    https://public-exchange.csl.sri.com/staff/Jill.Knight/private-I0Dat0DatBIo/elf_l1_c21lZGlh\n"], 'agent_name': 'jill.knight@csl.sri.com'}

This is quite confusing to me.\n    \n    Did you want the postal address or residential? I also have a vacation home. Do you need that one? I don't see why you would, but you tell me.\n    \n     I'm happy to provide you with the details you requested but I'm a wee bit nervous that I might accidently send them to someone I can't trust. Can you please confirm with me yo\nur email address and another so I can be sure? Or send me a picture of you so I know who I am dealing with.\n    I don't have a bank account. I have a credit union account. Would that be sufficient? \n    \n    I'm not sure how to transfer the funds. Will it be difficult? Do I need to get a lawyer? \n    Is there another website I could look at? Or perhaps you have a better ida of what my problems could be. \n    Is there some special form I have to fill out to tell you that I'm the beneficiary? What is your definition of beneficiary? \n    I would be happy to fill it out if you send it to me. Do we need a lawyer?\n    \n    OK.

By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about 8M or more.\n    \n    The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either av\noid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c\nonsignment is delayed and abandoned.\n    \n    As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali\nd non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi\ncation).
