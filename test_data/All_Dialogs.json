Last week Tuesday, as i was making my \nusual routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from London and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed huge sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box \nweighing approximately 110kg With Registration RBT-45C. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as \"MONEY\" \nrather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD. On m\ny assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Miami International Airport Miami Florida till date. The details of the consignment including your name,\n your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box.\n    \n    However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Num\nber and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that\n this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance process so as a res\nult of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account agentronaldmacleod26@gmail.com  So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will\n advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everythi\nng concluded within 48 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.\n    \n    Please Reconfirm The Following Information For Your Delivery.\n    \n    (1) Your name........... (2) Your phone number............. (3) Your complete address............. (4) Nearest airport to your address............. (5) Your Occupation.........\n.......\n    \n    Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and sh\nare the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediate\nly the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can br\ning it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share. I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still Sandersve and I will appreciate if we can ke\nep this deal confidential.\n    \n    Warmest Regards,\n    Chief Inspection Officer\n    AGENT Kimberly\n"},"2020-08-27 14:34:52":{"agentronaldmacleod26@gmail.com":"> IM1002 email to UID2/kimberly.sanders@csl.sri.com from UID349/agentronaldmacleod26@gmail.com at 20200827_143452\n    subject:  Re: [EXTERNAL] TRUTH ABOUT YOUR CONSIGNMENT\n\n     Operations, Maintenance and Transportation officer.\n    Miami International Airport 2100 NW 42nd Ave, Miami,\n    FL 33126, United States\n    INSPECTION UNIT\n    Text : (+1) 786-903-9979\n    \n    Congratulations\n    \n    Everything was successful as I have finally secured the release of your\n    consignment (SEALED FUND) after a heated negotiation with the airport vault\n    authorities and Federal Reserve bank New York.

The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c\nonsignment is delayed and abandoned.\n    \n    As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali\nd non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi\ncation).

The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignme=\n    nt was not\n    \n    properly declared by the consignee as \"MONEY\" rather it was declared as per=\n    sonal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat =\n    to pay for the\n    \n    United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD.

During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in New York, and when scanned\n it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $8M or more.\n    \n    The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either av\noid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c\nonsignment is delayed and abandoned.\n    \n    As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali\nd non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi\ncation).

I am interested. \n    \n      \n    Do you have a mobile number I can call? Or a ZOOM meeting room that we can chat with? \n     Or is there a better way to talk?  \n    \n    I still don't recall this package. Could it be for someone else? Or maybe different street? Who sent it or at least what city is it from? \n    \n    Could you take a picture of the package (which I think your company does) and email it to me? This is quite confusing to me.\n    \n    Did you want the postal address or residential? I also have a vacation home. Do you need that one? I don't see why you would, but you tell me.\n    \n     I'm happy to provide you with the details you requested but I'm a wee bit nervous that I might accidently send them to someone I can't trust. Can you please confirm with me yo\nur email address and another so I can be sure? Or send me a picture of you so I know who I am dealing with.\n    I don't have a bank account. I have a credit union account. Would that be sufficient? \n    \n    I'm not sure how to transfer the funds. Will it be difficult? Do I need to get a lawyer? \n    Is there another website I could look at?

During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in New York, and when scanned\n it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $8M or more.\n    \n    The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either av\noid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c\nonsignment is delayed and abandoned.\n    \n    As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali\nd non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi\ncation).
