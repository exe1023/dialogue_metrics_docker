My name is Kimberly Macleod, i am the Operations, Maintenance and Transportation officer here at the Miami International Airport FL, USA. Last week Tuesday, as i was making my usual routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from London and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed huge sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg With Registration RBT45C. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as \"MONEY\" rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is 3,700USD. On m y assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Miami International Airport Miami Florida till date. The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box. However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Num ber and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance process so as a res ult of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account   So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response.

By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about 8M or more. The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal document to either av oid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c onsignment is delayed and abandoned. As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali d non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi cation).

During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in New York, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about 8M or more. The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal document to either av oid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the c onsignment is delayed and abandoned. As I did say again, the Diplomat abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a vali d non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratifi cation).

I have been able to secure the service of a lawyer who will assist us with the procurement of the needed documents to give our claims legal backing and I have made an agreement to pay him some of his fees now and his balance after you have confirmed the money in your account. You need not worry as I would use my position to facilitate the approval and the subsequent release of the funds to you and Immediately the funds are released, they will be tra nsferred into a new offshore account, you will need to open with a bank I will recommend to you.
